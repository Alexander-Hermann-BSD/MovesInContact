MovesInContact
==============

The basic idea is, that unfortunately **Moves** *only __uses__* existing places from **FourSquare**. Furthermore, if you check in with *FourSquare*, it doesn't check in in *Moves* and vice versa. So ***MovesInContact*** try's to close that gap. 

## Starting part 
The starting part is to read and write data from *both*: _**Moves** and **FourSquare**_.
